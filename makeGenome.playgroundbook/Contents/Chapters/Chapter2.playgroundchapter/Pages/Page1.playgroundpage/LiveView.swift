 ## **Create a chromosome**
 
 Do you remember informations that you read in the previous chapter? Well, let's put ourselves to the test.
 Adenine, Cytosine, Guanine and Thymine can be joined together in pairs of two.
 The shapes of their heads are complementary.
 At the end, there is a surprise.
 
 **Challenge:** Choose which function to invoke to create the compliant chain, between `createTopChain()` & `createBottomChain()` ,to that shown on the screen and, subsequently, merge the bases in pairs of two, simply tapping on those of interest.
